    "- `Model Summary`\n",
    "    - `R-squared`: R-squared is possibly the most important measurement produced by this summary. R-squared is the measurement of how much of the independent variable is explained by changes in our dependent variables. In percentage terms, 0.957 would mean our model explains 95.7% of the change in our ‘Salary’ variable.\n",
    "    - `Adj. R-squared`: This is the modified version of R-squared which is adjusted for the number of variables in the regression. It increases only when an additional variable adds to the explanatory power to the regression.\n",
    "- `Coefficients`: These show the estimated effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "    - `Constants`: The constant 2.579e+04 (or 25,790) represents the expected Salary when YearsExperience is zero. However, interpret this cautiously as it may not be meaningful in real-world context.\n",
    "    -  `YearsExperience`: For each additional year of experience, the model predicts an increase of about 9,450 in Salary, holding other factors constant. \n",
    "    - `P-values`: These indicate the statistical significance of each coefficient. These indicate the statistical significance of each coefficient. Generally, a p-value < 0.05 is considered statistically significant."
