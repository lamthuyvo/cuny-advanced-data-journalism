    "### Text cleaning and topic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an example of topic modeling adapted from [this writeup](https://medium.com/@sayahfares19/text-analysis-topic-modelling-with-spacy-gensim-4cd92ef06e06).\n",
    "\n",
    "It performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the first part of the notebook loads texts from a spreadsheet and turns them into one large corpuse\n",
    "- then we walk through various ways in which we can analyze and clean our corpus using spaCy (this includes taking out `stopwords` â€” words most often used in the English language and lemmatizing our corpus)\n",
    "- to better understand how a model works this notebook also explores some funcationalities of spaCy\n",
    "- the last parts of this notebook then make a simple topics model from the cleaned language data\n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries we will use are:\n",
    "- `pandas`: for reading in and exporting spreadsheets\n",
    "- `spacy`: a natural language processing library that contains various models trained on various languages\n",
    "- `gensim`: a library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. In this case we will use it for topic modeling, the process of clustering words that seem to be used a lot in relation to one another. The algorithms built into genim that this notebook uses are called [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://towardsdatascience.com/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda-9d1cd064ffa2) and [Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)](https://blog.marketmuse.com/glossary/latent-semantic-analysis-definition/).\n",
    "- `pyLDAvis`: a library that is capable of visualizing your topics clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a form of unsupervised machine learning and can be really helpful in discovering topics in a large amount of text, especially if you're uncertain which topics might be buried in thousands or millions of documents. "
