I reply to my text, I get to my emails, I do a few, you know, picky, picky, flicky flicky flicky's. And that's why I'm a Verizon. Verizon lets me trade in a musty diva for a demure diva. Verizon lets anyone trade in a crusty phone for a new one. We don't have a crunchy phone, we don't do a crack screen. I'm not typing on my phone and getting cuts on my fingers. I'm not charging my phone and it's really what I will go and crazy on me. Thank you. You thought we'd get the bag? I take my bag, I'm very cute. I'm very respectful to the staff. I don't do crazy, I walk out with my nice new phone. And that's my partner with Verizon. She keeps her elegant, she keeps her cutesy, she keeps her classy. She does red, she doesn't do hot pink, she's not crazy, she's very demure."
