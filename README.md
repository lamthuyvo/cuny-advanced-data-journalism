## Course Description

Data sets are everywhere. In public sources, like election results, budgets and census reports; semi-public and private datasets, like hidden company information; in cross referencing people and organizations in documents and databases to discover conflicts of interest; in social media updates, images and video uploads. Data has become an invaluable resource for journalists to expose stories buried in the numbers and find relevant facts to shape them in newsworthy ways to produce great stories. And today, no matter if your goal is to cover a daily beat or to do enterprise or investigative stories, you are expected to be able to use it.

In this course, you will build the skills you need to do data journalism:



*   Data journalism history and principles.
*   How to find and acquire data using automated means (scraping!), as well as how to negotiate access to data with officials by using FOIA/FOIL.
*   Work with common data formats and different types of data, as well as to understand what sort of data are in rows and columns.
*   Discover how to spot errors, deal with missing values and messy data.
*   How to clean data, normalize it, analyze it and test your results using basic math, statistics and data journalism tools
*   To mix data skills with on-the ground reporting to be able to discover newsworthy stories in data and answer questions to do accountability journalism that serves the public interest.

 \
Most importantly, we want to focus on getting you the skills you need to find stories in data and be able to come to your editor with data-driven pitches.


### **How the class works**

This is a hands-on course. Each lesson will focus on one or two of our expected outcomes, moving sequentially through the course. Lessons will include:



*   Lectures, discussions and updates on your reporting
*   Lab time to work and practice with real datasets and use computer-assisted tools and basic programming (Google Sheets, Open Refine, command line, Python with Jupyter Notebooks) to obtain, clean, normalize, analyze and bulletproof data.

You will be expected to conduct the following work outside of the classroom:



*   Homework exercises
*   Readings
*   2 assignments

All the course materials will be shared by the instructors with the students on a Github and on Google Classroom.


### **Tools**

Some software is already installed on your laptop. Others, you will have to install on your own. The instructors will do an “install party” for this.



*   Google Sheets
*   Google Drive
*   Text editor [Atom](https://www.atom.io) or [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
*   Command line Terminal (already in your laptop)
*   Python: includes Jupyter Notebooks, data analysis packages, package management tools, and environment manager to create virtual environments.


## **Objective and outcomes**

The objective of this course is to train students in the fundamental skills to do data journalism and be ready to continue their training in the Advanced Data Journalism course.

At the end of this course you will be expected to be able to:



*   Understand the principles and process of doing data journalism.
*   Do online and offline research to obtain documents and data.
*   Understand and use public record laws to negotiate access to data.
*   Know the characteristics of different file formats and types of data
*   Check quality of data to identify errors, missing values and how to solve this issues.
*   Use basic math and descriptive and inferential statistics for data analysis.
*   Organize, explore, clean and do accurate solid analysis of different types of data by using the tools of data journalism (Google Sheets, Open Refine, command line, Python with packages and Jupyter Notebooks ).
*   Ask interesting and answerable questions of data.
*   Maintain data integrity and use best practices in data journalism for reproducibility methods.
*   Combine data work with fact checking, interviewing sources and on-the ground reporting to produce quality journalism.
*   Evaluate professional data stories (what makes a particular project successful or not?).

## **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Class rules</span>**

**Students-Instructors contract:** The success of this course depends on the level of commitment of each student. That is, it is up to each student to carry out their class work and assignments as well as to contribute to their team’s reporting project and speak up about any doubts or concerns you may have. In return, the instructors will do their best to provide a clear lesson plan, give students timely feedback and advice them to achieve the course’s expected outcomes.

**Attendance and punctuality:** We meet 15 times during the spring semester. You must attend every class and be on time. If you’re sick or you have an emergency, let us know via Slack or text. If you don’t show up, you will hear from us. More than one unexcused absence will penalize your overall grade by 5%. Similarly, two tardiness equals an absence.

**Deadlines matter.** This is of vital importance, not only for the class but also in the professional career of any journalist, because deadlines are sacred. Please carefully note these rule: there will be a 10 percent deduction of your assignment grade for every 24 hours that passes after a deadline in which you have not turned it in. No exceptions. Except medical emergency or family emergency. Make-up work will not be offered except in extenuating circumstances.

**Communicate.** If you have a problem or if you have difficulties, tell us right away, not after is too late. In journalism that’s what we do. When we have a problem we immediately tell our editor.

**Be accurate and use language correctly.** The value of journalistic work depends on credibility. That is why class assignments must have a rigorous verification of the data and information presented. That is the basis of the profession. A story with erroneous information can carry out an F grade. We expect the language to be used correctly. Follow the AP Style guidelines. Aim for clarity, precision and correct spelling and grammar.

**Keep up with the news.** Consuming information on a daily basis leads to a healthy diet of background, helps you connect the dots and discover story ideas to work on. If you care about a topic or your subject concentration you have to stay in top of the game.

**Be a pro.** Honesty, courtesy, curiosity and professionalism are the core values of a journalist. Behave like one because you are a journalist. When classmates are presenting or we have guests or we are working in teams don’t multitask, focus.

**Participation**. It is important to maintain an attitude of openness. Class time is reserved for learning and discussing the topics of each session. It is not the time for personal calls, text messages, emails and social networks.

**Diversity and inclusion.** It's critical that students learn to include a diverse set of voices in their stories, something that is often glossed over when finding stories in spreadsheets and online sources. You are encouraged and expected to look for stories about and voices from communities that are underrepresented. This also applies to our classroom. It requires us all to discuss differences with respect and empathy, regarding race, gender, age, religion, sexual preference, disability, language, origin or political beliefs.

**Code of honor.** This class follows the guidelines of the Student Handbook of our school. More so, in journalism plagiarism or falsification of data, sources and facts are serious crimes that can lead to failing this class. You may also be the subject of suspension, probation or expulsion, pending the decision of the School administration.
